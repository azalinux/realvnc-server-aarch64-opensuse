# realvnc-server-aarch64-opensuse

******** Still Testing - BETA ******

RealVNC Server Version:    6.7.2.43081

This repository is for installing RealVNC Server ARM64 edition on OpenSuse Leap 15.2+ / Tumblweed for your Raspberry Pi device.  Has been tested using a Pi4 with 8gb RAM and on multiple desktop environments including XFCE, LXQT & Plasma.

INSTALLATION::

To install, clone the git respository and use the included install script:

zypper install git                           

git clone https://github.com/azalinux/testing

./install.sh

No activation key is needed if using on a Raspberry Pi device.  ** This is intended for Personal Use only! **



I may produce a RPM binary at some point in the future however at this stage a manual install script will suffice.
