# realvnc-server-aarch64-opensuse

******** Still Testing - BETA ******

This repository is for installing RealVNC Server ARM64 edition on OpenSuse Leap 15.2+ / Tumblweed for your Raspberry Pi device.  Has been tested using a Pi4 with 8gb RAM and on multiple desktop environments including XFCE, LXQT & Plasma.

INSTALLATION

To install, clone the git respository and use the included install script.

I may produce a RPM binary at some point in the future however at this stage a manual install script will suffice.
